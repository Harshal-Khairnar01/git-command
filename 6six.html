  <h1>What is <code>git revert</code>?</h1>
  <p>
    The <code>git revert</code> command creates a new commit that undoes the changes
    introduced by a previous commit.  
    Unlike <code>git reset</code>, it does not delete history — instead, it adds a safe "undo" commit.
  </p>

  <h2>Why use it?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To safely undo changes in a shared/public branch.</li>
    <li>To preserve commit history for better tracking.</li>
    <li>To avoid rewriting history (important when others have pulled your branch).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Basic Usage</h2>

  <h3>1. Revert a specific commit</h3>
  <pre>
git revert &lt;commit-hash&gt;
  </pre>
  <p>This will open the default editor to write a commit message for the revert.</p>

  <h3>2. Revert without opening an editor</h3>
  <pre>
git revert &lt;commit-hash&gt; --no-edit
  </pre>

  <h3>3. Revert multiple commits</h3>
  <pre>
git revert &lt;oldest-commit&gt;^..&lt;newest-commit&gt;
  </pre>

  <h3>4. Revert the latest commit</h3>
  <pre>
git revert HEAD
  </pre>

  <h2>Example Workflow</h2>
  <pre>
# View commit history
git log --oneline

# Suppose the commit hash is abc123
git revert abc123

# Git will create a new commit that undoes abc123
  </pre>

  <h2>Important Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Revert is non-destructive</b> — it doesn’t remove commits.</li>
    <li>Good for undoing changes in branches used by others.</li>
    <li>If there are conflicts during revert, Git will ask you to resolve them before committing.</li>
    <li>For local private branches, <code>git reset</code> might be faster if you don't care about keeping history.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Difference Between Revert and Reset</h2>
  <pre>
git revert   # Creates a new commit that undoes previous changes
git reset    # Moves HEAD to a previous commit, removing commits from history (dangerous in shared repos)
  </pre>
