    <h1>What is <code>git restore</code>?</h1>
    <p>
        The <code>git restore</code> command is used to restore working directory files
        to a previous state.
        It can discard changes in files, restore them from the last commit, or even unstage files.
    </p>

    <h2>Basic Usage</h2>

    <h3>1. Restore a single file to last committed version</h3>
    <pre>
git restore filename.txt
  </pre>
    <p>This replaces the file with its version from the last commit.</p>

    <h3>2. Restore multiple files</h3>
    <pre>
git restore file1.txt file2.txt
  </pre>

    <h3>3. Restore an entire folder</h3>
    <pre>
git restore src/
  </pre>

    <h3>4. Restore all changed files in the working directory</h3>
    <pre>
git restore .
  </pre>

    <h2>Restoring staged changes</h2>
    <p>If you already staged changes with <code>git add</code> but want to unstage them:</p>
    <pre>
git restore --staged filename.txt
  </pre>
    <p>Now the file remains modified in the working directory but is no longer staged for commit.</p>

    <h2>Restoring to a specific commit</h2>
    <pre>
git restore --source &lt;commit-hash&gt; filename.txt
  </pre>
    <p>This brings back the file as it was in the given commit.</p>

    <h2>Important Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Changes restored this way are <b>lost</b> if they are not committed anywhere.</li>
        <li>Use with caution â€” there is no undo unless you have the changes saved in another commit or stash.</li>
        <li><code>git restore</code> was introduced in Git 2.23 (Aug 2019) to simplify commands like
            <code>git checkout -- file</code>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example Workflow</h2>
    <pre>
# You modify a file
echo "new content" >> hello.txt

# Check status
git status
# hello.txt is modified

# Discard changes
git restore hello.txt

# Now hello.txt is back to its last committed state
  </pre>
